   Original Geeklog Plugin by Dirk Haun
   Bad Behavior2 Plugin Upgrade by Mark R. Evans

Bad Behavior complements other link spam solutions by acting as a gatekeeper,
preventing spammers from ever delivering their junk, and in many cases, from
ever reading your site in the first place. This keeps your site's load down,
makes your site logs cleaner, and can help prevent denial of service
conditions caused by spammers.
(quoted from <http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/>)

INSTALLATION

(For upgrading instructions, see below)

With one exception (see step 5), this plugin installs like any other Geeklog
plugin:

1) Unpack bad_behavior2_2.0.25-1.4.1.tar.gz
2) Upload the contents of the public_html directory into
   /path/to/geeklog/public_html/bad_behavior2
3) Upload the contents of the admin directory into
   /path/to/geeklog/public_html/admin/plugins/bad_behavior2
4) Upload the functions.inc file and language directory into
   /path/to/geeklog/plugins/bad_behavior2

***** IMPORTANT! EXTRA STEP FOR THIS PLUGIN *****

5) Edit your lib-common.php file. Find the line where the lib-database.php is
   included:

   require_once( $_CONF['path_system'] . 'lib-database.php' );

   AFTER that line, add:

   require_once($_CONF['path_html'] . 'bad_behavior2/bad-behavior-geeklog.php');

6) Log in as the Admin, select "Plugins" from the Admin block and click on
   "Install" for the bad_behavior2 plugin

UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from v1.2.4-1 you must first uninstall the existing
plugin before you install v2.0.25.

  - Perform a standard plugin uninstall - Plugins -> Bad Behavior - Delete
  - Do not forget to remove the Bad Behavior 1 lib-common.php entry
  - Do not forget to remove the Bad Behavior 1 Spam-X module
       Remove /path/to/geeklog/plugins/spamx/BadBehavior.Action.class.php
       Subtract the value of 64 from the entry in $_CONF['spamx'] in
          Geeklog's main config.php file.

Upgrading from earlier 2.0.x releases

If you were running an earlier version of Bad Behavior 2 before, you need to
replace the contents of the bad_behavior2 directory (in your site's public_html
directory) with the contents of the included public_html directory. Make sure
to replace all the files in all the subdirectories there!

The other file you should replace is the plugin's functions.inc file.

Once you've done that, log into your site as an Admin user, and select
"Plugins". The entry for the Bad Behavior plugin should report the need to
update the plugin. Do that by clicking on the "edit" icon for that plugin,
and then select "Update". That concludes the update process.


CONFIGURATION

There is only one configuration option with Bad Behavior2, the 'strict' option.

To change the configuration option, you will need to edit the file

    public_html/bad_behavior2/bad-behavior-geeklog.php

Near the top you will see:

    $bb2_settings_defaults = array(
    	'log_table'     => $_DB_table_prefix . 'bad_behavior2',
    	'display_stats' => true,
    	'strict'        => false,
    	'verbose'       => false
    );

The only option you should change is the 'strict' option.

strict: Enables strict mode blocking. When turned on, certain types of
        spam will be blocked, but legitimate corporate and government users
        may also be blocked. This is off by default.

Spam-X module

This version of Bad Behavior does not include the Spam-X module.
Bad Behavior2 no longer bans by IP, instead it checks each HTTP request, so
the Spam-X module is no longer useful since IPs are no longer banned.

Searching

Users in the Bad Behavior2 Admin group can search the Bad Behavior2 logs.
Simply go to Geeklog's search page and enter your search terms. Select
"Bad Behavior2" from the "Type" drop-down menu if you only want to perform a
search on the Bad Behavior2 logs.

The search function will search for IP addresses and it also searches through
the entire HTTP request that the offender used to access the site.

Stats

Bad Behavior2 also displays a section in your site's statistics. In addition
to the total number of blocked requests, it also displays a list of the most
common misbehaviors. These statistics are only visible to members of the
'Bad Behavior2 Admin' group.

This Geeklog plugin provides a wrapper around Michael's plugin and adds
a few Geeklog-specific extras, e.g. the ability to view the blocked requests
and to search through the list of blocked requests.
